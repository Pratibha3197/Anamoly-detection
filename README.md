**Assignment Requirement**

Detect anomaly and alert defects from an unstructured data pool received from current sensors of a 3-phase induction motor at a rate of 10K - 15K instances per second. 

Dataset:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d70I-XacHhA7i7MsVQa-iFJvp2nTiayA?usp=share_link

the data set contains current readings of a 3-phase AC motor (3.2hp) 
motor current signature analysis and model-based VI analysis to be done to detect anomalies 

Structure/process the data, create condition indicators, create an ML model, and create features to train the model.  The model should learn, and predict future anomalies. 
For other data, you can get data set from kaggle or other online sources as well.

Study on MCSA, model-based VI analysis, and how they're applied to predict machine failure.

Timeline: 48hrs (from the day you receive the task)
How to submit:
Share it on GitHub or GitLab with proper documentation 
1. what you have done - logic
2. how it can be set up and tested in an isolated system (share deployable/dockerized code)
3. create an anomaly in the data set provided and show that your code can detect it (TDD testing)
